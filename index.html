            About the Game..
        </h2>
        <p class="section-paragraph">
            Planet Man is very simple in design and the end goal is nothing but achievable. This is a game designed for all age groups. 
            The main goal of the game is to collect the stars and avoid the planets, if you hit a planet you will return to your starting position and your score will be reset.
            however if you manage to keep avoiding the planets with every star you collect you will gain 5 points, this will keep adding up until you eventually collide with a planet.
            Your high score will be saved and you can see this in the top right hand corner of the game, in the top left hand corner is your curret score but remember not to look at it for to long
            you never know which planet may be around the corner.
