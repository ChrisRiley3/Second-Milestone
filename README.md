# Planet Man - Second Milestone Project

Hello and welcome to my Second milestone project. this project will help to get a first time game developers game out there for users to experience and supply feedback. When visiting the website the users will be hit with information about the developer and what his goals are in the future. The user will be able to find information about the game on the home page and what its end goals are.

The game itself is a very simple but addicting game. The games path is simple so it attracts people of all ages. there is no over complicated story to follow the game is designed so that a user can come along visit the website and start playing straight away without having to remember where they left off and just pass the time. The goal is simple get a high score and eventually the users will be able to play against each others high scores when a leader board is added to the game.
