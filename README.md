# Planet Man - Second Milestone Project

Hello and welcome to my Second milestone project. this project will help to get a first time game developers game out there for users to experience and supply feedback. When visiting the website the users will be hit with information about the developer and what his goals are in the future. The user will be able to find information about the game on the home page and what its end goals are.

The game itself is a very simple but addicting game. The games path is simple so it attracts people of all ages. there is no over complicated story to follow the game is designed so that a user can come along visit the website and start playing straight away without having to remember where they left off and just pass the time. The goal is simple get a high score and eventually the users will be able to play against each others high scores when a leader board is added to the game.

# UX

This project uses skills that i have learned so far working through the course and skilled that i have acquired from my own research to create a responsive website that supplies a game that users can come and enjoy playing. The aim of this website is to provide a enjoyable game for users to come and experience so they can work to beat high scores set by themselves. The feedback that is left by users will be used to help better the game and add new features so the users are always happy and the game stays interesting. Creating this game i am helping better myself and my skills and showcasing something that i am really interested in and potentailly want to persue in the future.
